Experimental data of cellulose solutions.

This is data from SAXS which has not been normalised. In this case that means that the scattering length densities are not on a meaningful scale so they have simply been set to arbitrary values with the scale parameter being fitted. The model used here is a cylinder with an elliptical cross section. There are two datasets that have been independently fitted. The samples are related but at different concentrations. 

The various shell scripts given here should all be run from the cellulose directory. Paths are all relative. 

Files:
q32.txt		Experimental data of cellulose at lower concentration.
bag_write.sh	A shell command to run the cli.py script, the script still requires
	 	parameters. These are given in q32_params.txt
q_32params.txt	The parameters required for generating the bag of tasks
bagout.sh 	The bag of tasks file generated by the above process for the q32 dataset
output/		Directory holding the output of the q32 bag of tasks fits (results may not 		be identical on a different system). All fits converge to the same final
		parameter set. 
q32_process.sh	Shell script to run the processing script
q32_out.txt	The results of running process.py over the fitting outputs

The outputs in this case converge to one fit where the cross section is an ellipse with a minor radius of 16.8 A and major radius of 52 A (radius ratio of 3.1) and a cylinder length of 715 A.

The second dataset is actually the same material but at a higher concentration. On my first attempt I tried to fit this with a wide set of parameter values but the fits were not converging so I returned to a smaller parameter spread:

Files:
q48.txt			Experimental data of cellulose at higher concentration.
bag_write_q48.sh	A shell command to run the cli.py script, the script still
		 	requires parameters. These are given in q48_params.txt
q_48_params.txt		The parameters required for generating the bag of tasks
bagout_q48.sh 		The bag of tasks file generated by the above process for
			the q32 dataset
output_q48/		Directory holding the output of the q32 bag of tasks fits 
			(results may not be identical on a different system). All 
			fits converge to the same final parameter set. 
q48_process.sh		Shell script to run the processing script
q48_out.txt		The results of running process.py over the fitting outputs


Following this set with them all converging a second run was carried out with a wider parameter sweep.

New Files:
q_48_params_2.txt	The parameters required for generating the bag of tasks
bagout_q48_2.sh 	The bag of tasks file generated by the above process for 
			the q32 dataset
output_q48_2/		Directory holding the output of the q32 bag of tasks fits 
			(results may not be identical on a different system). All 
			fits converge to the same final parameter set. 
q48_2_process.sh	Shell script to run the processing script
q48_2_out.txt		The results of running process.py over the fitting outputs

In this case one of the starting parameter sets converges to a different optimum but the rest all converge to the same as previously. The new minima has about three times the chi2 value of the original optimal fit.
