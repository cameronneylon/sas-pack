Experimental data of an elliptical surfactant-polymer aggregate.

This is data from SAXS which has not been normalised. In this case that means that the scattering length densities are not on a meaningful scale so they have simply been set to arbitrary values with the scale being fitted.

The various shell scripts given here should all be run from the micelles directory. Paths are all relative. All 25 fits converged in this case.

Files:
pei_ctab.dat	The experimental data file
bag_write.sh	A shell command to run the cli.py script, the script still requires
	 	parameters. These are given in params.txt
params1.txt	The parameters required for generating the bag of tasks
bagout1.sh 	The bag of tasks file generated by the above process
output1/	Directory holding the output of the bag of tasks fits (results may not be
		identical on a different system). The first six fits did not converge 
		and the second six did.
process.sh	Shell script to run the processing script
process_out.txt	The results of running process.py over the fitting outputs

The outputs in this case converge mainly to one fit where radius_a is 5nm and radius_b is 20 nm (the measures are nanometers rather than angstroms because of the scale the experimental data is on - this is actually hard to tell from data files but generally where x[q] values go above 2 the scale is nanometres).

This fit is actually rather poor but that is a deficiency of the model not of the fitting process or the numbers themselves. The deficiency is the lack of a "structure factor" that gives information on particle-particle interactions (i.e. there is a repulsive interaction between the ellipses). It would be interesting in the future to test whether the fits obtained from models with a structure factor are statistically better than those fits obtained from the same model, but without.

If this were neutron data the next step would be to fix the physical dimensions and scale and to fit the scattering length densities. However as this data is in an arbitrary intensity (vertical) scale this doesn't actually make sense to do.
