Experimental data of an ellipsoidal/cylindrical protein aggregate.

The data fits well to both cylinder and to ellipse models with lengths of around 100-200 A and a radius of around 40 A. The protein (cylinder or ellipse) SLD is 3.22e-6 (known from composition) and the data was taken in D2O so the solvent SLD is 6.35e-6. Both of these should remain fixed in any fit. For testing purposes it makes most sense to fit the length (or second radius for the ellipse model), radius, scale, and background.

The various shell scripts given here should all be run from the pin_a directory. Paths are all relative.

Files:
pin_a.xml	The experimental data file
bag_write.sh	A shell command to run the cli.py script, the script still requires parameters. These are
 		given in params.txt
params.txt	The parameters required for generating the bag of tasks
bagout.sh 	The bag of tasks file generated by the above process
output/		Directory holding the output of the bag of tasks fits (results may not be identical on
		a different system). The first six fits did not converge and the second six did.
process.sh	Shell script to run the processing script
process_out.txt	The results of running process.py over the fitting outputs

The outputs in this case suggest a fairly consistent radius of around 40 A (two fits converge to values close to this) but with a rather poorly determined length (the various fit classes give very different lengths (320 vs 780 A). The third class of fit can be rejected because it contains a negative length and scale value.

The obvious next step in this case is to run a set of fits starting from the consistent radius but testing different starting lengths. This process is explored in the files as below:

bag_write2.sh
params2.txt
bagout2.sh
output2/
process2.sh
process_out2.txt

The result of this is that those two fits are both stable, suggesting that the data does not constrain the length very well or conversely that the model may not be appropriate. If we accept the model then the results suggest that the radius is well defined by the data but the length is not. The next obvious step would be to test similar but different models.
